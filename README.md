# Radar

Motion Tracker, for 2D video game. Use a Fisheye lens algorithm to represent xenomorph coordinates on radar mapping system.

The white circle represent the radar maximum range, any xenomorph outside the white circle will be invisible to the radar. 

The echo is proportional to the screen centre (maximum gain in the centre).

You can of course place the radar referential point to a different location if you need to show only enemy coming from ahead.
